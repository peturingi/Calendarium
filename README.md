# Calendarium

Calendarium shows the total hours spend on events entered added to macOS's built-in Calendar app.

### Idea
The idea is to enable users to use the Calendar app (therefor CalDAV [RFC 4791]), a simple app which most users already know how to use, to log hours worked on different projects.

### Use Case
An example use case is one in which a freelancer wishes to track how many hours he has spend working on projects for different clients.
